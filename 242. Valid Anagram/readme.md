## Problem Description

Given two strings `s` and `t`, write a function to determine if `t` is an anagram of `s`.

#### Example 1:
```plaintext\n
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
```
#### Example 2:
```plaintext\n
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
```
## Constraints

- `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.

## Notes

- An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

## Concept
1. Count all charactor number are same or not
