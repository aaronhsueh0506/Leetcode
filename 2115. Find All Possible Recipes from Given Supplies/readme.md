## Problem Description

You have information about `n` different recipes. You are given a string array `recipes` and a 2D string array `ingredients`. The `ith` recipe has the name `recipes[i]`, and you can **create** it if you have all the needed ingredients from `ingredients[i]`. Ingredients to a recipe may need to be created from other recipes, i.e., `ingredients[i]` may contain a string that is in `recipes`.

You are also given a string array `supplies` containing all the ingredients that you initially have, and you have an infinite supply of all of them.

Return a list of all the recipes that you can create. You may return the answer in **any order**.

Note that two recipes may contain each other in their ingredients.

 

#### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: recipes = ["bread"], ingredients = [["yeast","flour"]], supplies = ["yeast","flour","corn"]
Output: ["bread"]
Explanation:
We can create "bread" since we have the ingredients "yeast" and "flour".
```
#### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: recipes = ["bread","sandwich"], ingredients = [["yeast","flour"],["bread","meat"]], supplies = ["yeast","flour","meat"]
Output: ["bread","sandwich"]
Explanation:
We can create "bread" since we have the ingredients "yeast" and "flour".
We can create "sandwich" since we have the ingredient "meat" and can create the ingredient "bread".
```
#### Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: recipes = ["bread","sandwich","burger"], ingredients = [["yeast","flour"],["bread","meat"],["sandwich","meat","bread"]], supplies = ["yeast","flour","meat"]
Output: ["bread","sandwich","burger"]
Explanation:
We can create "bread" since we have the ingredients "yeast" and "flour".
We can create "sandwich" since we have the ingredient "meat" and can create the ingredient "bread".
We can create "burger" since we have the ingredient "meat" and can create the ingredients "bread" and "sandwich".
 ```

## Constraints

- `n == recipes.length == ingredients.length`
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `1 <= ingredients[i].length, supplies.length <= 100`
- `1 <= recipes[i].length, ingredients[i][j].length, supplies[k].length <= 10`
- `recipes[i], ingredients[i][j]`, and `supplies[k]` consist only of lowercase English letters.
- All the values of `recipes` and `supplies` combined are unique.
- Each `ingredients[i]` does not contain any duplicate values.

## Concept
1. Create an undirected graph for `recipes` and `ingredients`, also record the number of `ingredients` required for each `recipe`.
2. Add all `supplied ingredients` to the initial queue, and use BFS to identify which recipes can be made.
3. Each BFS iteration processes an ingredient from the queue. This `ingredient` may be connected to several `recipes`. If decrementing the `indeg` of a `recipe` (`--indeg[recipe]`) reaches `0`, it means all `ingredients` for that recipe have been collected. Thus, add the recipe to the queue and to the result list (`res`).
