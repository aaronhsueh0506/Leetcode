## Problem Decsription

Given an `m x n` matrix `board` containing `'X'` and `'O'`, capture all regions that are 4-directionally surrounded by `'X'`.

A region is captured by flipping all `'O'`s into `'X'`s in that surrounded region.

#### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
Output: [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
Explanation: Surrounded regions should not be on the border, which means that any `'O'` on the border of the board are not flipped to `'X'`. Any `'O'` that is not on the border and it is not connected to an `'O'` on the border will be flipped to `'X'`. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.
```
#### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: board = [["X"]]
Output: [["X"]]
```

## Constraints

- `m == board.length`
- `n == board[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 200`
- `board[i][j]` is `'X'` or `'O'`.

## Concept
1. Use DFS and start from 'O's on the boundary to mark them.
2. All unmarked 'O's will become 'X's.
