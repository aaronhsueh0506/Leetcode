## Problem Description

Implement `FreqStack`, a class which simulates the operation of a stack-like data structure.

`FreqStack` has two functions:

- `push(int x)`, which pushes an integer `x` onto the stack.
- `pop()`, which removes and returns the most frequent element in the stack.
    - If there is a tie for most frequent element, the element closest to the top of the stack is removed and returned.

**Example 1:**

```plaintext
Input:
["FreqStack","push","push","push","push","push","push","pop","pop","pop","pop"],
[[],[5],[7],[5],[7],[4],[5],[],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,null,null,null,null,null,null,5,7,5,4]
Explanation:
After making six .push operations, the stack is [5,7,5,7,4,5] from bottom to top. Then:

pop() -> returns 5, as 5 is the most frequent.
The stack becomes [5,7,5,7,4].

pop() -> returns 7, as 5 and 7 are tied for most frequent, but 7 is closer to the top.
The stack becomes [5,7,5,4].

pop() -> returns 5.
The stack becomes [5,7,4].

pop() -> returns 4.
The stack becomes [5,7].

```

## Constraints:


## Concept
1. use two hash table, one record val-times, second record times-vecotr of val
