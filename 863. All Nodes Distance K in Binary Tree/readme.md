## Problem Description

Given a binary tree, the root node `root`, a target node `target`, and an integer `k`, return *all the values of the nodes that have a distance `k` from the target node*. You can return the answer in **any order**.

#### Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], target = 5, k = 2
Output: [7,4,1]

Explanation: The nodes that are a distance 2 from the target node (with value 5) are nodes 7, 4, and 1.
```
#### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: root = [1], target = 1, k = 3
Output: []
```
### Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 500]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 500`
- All the values `Node.val` are **unique**.
- `target` is a node in the tree.
- `0 <= k <= 1000`.

## Concept
1. Create a undirectional graph for each node (because max node is 500, create a graph with 501)
2. Start from target node, using BFS to find the distance, put target->val to queue and visited array.
