# Description
You are given two **non-empty** linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in **reverse order**, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

3. check next val is null or not
  * l1 and l2 are null, end
  * l1 is null, then concate l2, end
  * l2 is null, create zero node (if cur need carry)
