## Problem Description

Design a data structure that follows the constraints of a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache.

Implement the `LRUCache` class:

- `LRUCache(int capacity)` Initialize the LRU cache with positive size capacity.
- `int get(int key)` Return the value of the key if the key exists, otherwise return -1.
- `void put(int key, int value)` Update the value of the key if the key exists. Otherwise, add the key-value pair to the cache. If the number of keys exceeds the capacity from this operation, evict the least recently used key.

The functions `get` and `put` must each run in O(1) average time complexity.

#### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input
["LRUCache", "put", "put", "get", "put", "get", "put", "get", "get", "get"]
[[2], [1, 1], [2, 2], [1], [3, 3], [2], [4, 4], [1], [3], [4]]
Output
[null, null, null, 1, null, -1, null, -1, 3, 4]

Explanation
LRUCache lRUCache = new LRUCache(2);
lRUCache.put(1, 1); // cache is {1=1}
lRUCache.put(2, 2); // cache is {1=1, 2=2}
lRUCache.get(1); // return 1
lRUCache.put(3, 3); // LRU key was 2, evicts key 2, cache is {1=1, 3=3}
lRUCache.get(2); // returns -1 (not found)
lRUCache.put(4, 4); // LRU key was 1, evicts key 1, cache is {4=4, 3=3}
lRUCache.get(1); // returns -1 (not found)
lRUCache.get(3); // returns 3
lRUCache.get(4); // returns 4
```
## Constraints

- `1 <= capacity <= 3000`
- `0 <= key <= 10^4`
- `0 <= value <= 10^5`
- At most `2 * 10^5` calls will be made to `get` and `put`.

## Concept
1. Because the operation needs to be O(1), use a list for insertion and deletion to achieve O(1) complexity.
2. Find the element in O(1), use hash table.
3. Use a hash table to map each key to the address of the pair {key, value}.
4. In the get function, move the element to the front by using splice.
5. In the put function, remove the element if it exists, then use push_front to add it to the list, and update the address in the hash table to list.begin().
6. If exceeding the capacity, remove the last element in the list and also remove the corresponding key from the hash table.
